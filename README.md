GT Coding Boot Camp Week 3 HW Password Generator

This repo uses Javascript written in [JavaScript](./script.js) to generate passwords for the user based on three levels of complexity.

The given levels are categorized as "Low", "Medium", and "High" and use a combination of lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters for generation.

Password is created using a combination of Math.random() and character banks being manipulated within nested switch statements first by complexity, then by character type.

Example of complexity prompt:
